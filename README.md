# My-Match-Game
Description: My first game game project with HTML, CSS and JS.  The object of the game is to remember the cards you flipped and match them up.  You are competing against time only.  The timer begins when the first card is flipped and stops when all the cards are matched. 

How to play: Single click on 2 cards in succession.  If the cards match, they will stay face up.  If the cards do not match, they will turn back face down.  Remember which card is where so you can match all 12 pairs.

Bug to fix: If you double click on the first card, that card is disabled face-down.
